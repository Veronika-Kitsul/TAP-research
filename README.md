TAP-research
------------

Questions of the week:
- do we cite the dataset separately from the paper about the dataset? (I assume so because those two have different links)
- I don't have access to two of the papers in the bibliography:
   * https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3131365.3131369
   * https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2858036.2858556

---------

Background section plan
- TAP
- talk about different TAPs, like IFTTT, Zappier, etc.
- what else? 
----------

Notes to Veronika (myself):
- fix bibtex for two articles I am planning to add and make sure that citation key is different for them
- https://ifttt.com/plans. --- cite it for ifttt services
