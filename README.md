TAP-research
------------

Questions of the week:
- PFE - is the only con potential slowliness? Shall we make a pros and cons list?
- I feel like PFE sounds better than MPC here and might be a good and potentially novel (?) way to go for TAP, does it? 
- Can you explain the abstract of paper 6 on PFE in more general terms? 

---------

Background section plan
- TAP
- talk about different TAPs, like IFTTT, Zappier, etc.
- what else? 
----------

Notes to Veronika (myself):
- fix bibtex for two articles I am planning to add and make sure that citation key is different for them
- https://ifttt.com/plans. --- cite it for ifttt services
