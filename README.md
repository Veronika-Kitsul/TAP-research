TAP-research
------------

Questions of the week:

- do we use TCP/IP or add other protocols to our network?
- develope further timeline?
-

IFTTT:
- Wifi password from google assistant https://ifttt.com/applets/EQ6xwrTD-wifi-password?term=password
- For new account notifications sent to your email. Toodledo will store basic information. Then later add login and password to Toodledo, or your password manager https://ifttt.com/applets/HnDGSTkE-new-accounts?term=password
- Create a customizable form to collect details from paid members into Google Sheets. On a successful enable, a shareable URL to a custom form will be sent to your IFTTT email address. Only members of your channel can use the custom form. If enabled, an email will be sent when a member submits the form to you. https://ifttt.com/connections/DsztxHNf-collect-paid-member-details?term=address
- If someone calls, start maps and show his location, https://ifttt.com/applets/hJMKghVa-if-someone-calls-start-maps-and-show-his-location?term=location

Background section plan
- TAP
- talk about different TAPs, like IFTTT, Zappier, etc.
- write about MPC and garbled circuits
- do we write anything about semi-honest security in the background or design, or do we not talk about it explicitly?

Notes to Veronika (myself):
- fix bibtex for two articles I am planning to add and make sure that citation key is different for them
- https://ifttt.com/plans. --- cite it for ifttt services
- oaf tokens and API

maybe google will be comfortable with their emails on IFTTT using this new design
