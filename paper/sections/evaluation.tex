\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:evaluation}

We experimentally answer the following questions:
\begin{itemize}
  \item What are the computation and communication costs for each of the parties
    in our system?
  \item How do the added privacy and anonymity guarantees affect the latency and
    throughput of our system?
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Computation and communication costs.}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Client to TAP.} What are the computation and communication costs
    to generate garbled circuits?
  \item \textbf{Trigger service to TAP.} Given trigger data, what are
    computation and communication costs to execute predicates over trigger data
    and send garbled inputs to the TAP?
  \item \textbf{TAP to action service.} What are the computation and
    communication costs to execute transformations using MPC and send the
    results to the action service?
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Throughput and latency.}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Throughput.} How many recipes executions per time period can the
    TAP execute?
  \item \textbf{Latency.} How long does it take to execute a recipe end-to-end
    from trigger data arrival at the trigger service to action data decryption
    at the action service?
\end{itemize}
