The Internet of Things (IoT) devices are constantly increasing in their popularity with more than 10 billion active devices in 2021~\cite{DBLP:webpage/Bojan/IoTstats}. To expand their network and support more services, IoT devices are oftentimes integrated with third-party services called Trigger-action platforms (TAP)~\cite{DBLP:journals/access/XuZZCDG19}. As people around the world start using IoT in the context of smart homes more and more, the ability to connect devices to other digital services is a very helpful automation technique that can do small and monotonous tasks for the user.
