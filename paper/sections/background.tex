The Internet of Things (IoT) devices are constantly increasing in their popularity with more than 10 billion
active devices in 2021~\cite{DBLP:webpage/Bojan/IoTstats}. To expand their network and support more
services, IoT devices are oftentimes integrated with third-party services called Trigger-action systems
~\cite{DBLP:journals/access/XuZZCDG19}. As people around the world start using IoT in the
context of smart homes more and more, the ability to connect devices to other digital services is a very
helpful automation technique that can do small and monotonous tasks for the user. 

Trigger-action systems have three main components: trigger service (TS), action service (AS), and
trigger-action platform (TAP). Users interact with it through their computer connected to the cloud or
