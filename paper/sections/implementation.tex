\subsection{Used tools}

We implement a prototype of \sys in Rust. Chen et al. \cite{DBLP:conf/sp/ChenCWSCF21} in their work use Python, however, we provide some reasons why we think Rust is better here: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item very fast and memory efficient (about on the same speed level as C);
	\item powerful features for combining many functions and libraries;
	\item extensive support system and vast amount of available crates;
	\item ensures high safety, the compiler pings every possible bug (prevention of references to freed memory, concurrent memory access, etc.);
	\item gives the ability to claim ownership of specific pieces of data, nothing else will be able to modify it;
	\item efficient succinct code;
	\item number one choice among many computer science researchers.
\end{itemize}
