\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Internet of Things (IoT) devices are becoming ubiquitous, with more than ten
billion active devices in 2021~\cite{DBLP:webpage/Bojan/IoTstats}. As users
increasingly use IoT devices in their smart homes, the ability to connect
devices to one another is a useful automation technique for performing small and
monotonous tasks. To facilitate this automation, trigger-action platforms (TAPs)
offer a platform for connecting and integrating these third-party IoT
services~\cite{DBLP:journals/access/XuZZCDG19, DBLP:conf/chi/UrHBLMPSL16}.

Trigger-action platforms (TAPs) comprise several parts: \emph{services},
\emph{platforms}, and \emph{recipes}. A client can install a recipe that
connects two services together on a platform. For example, suppose the client
wears a Fitbit to track their sleep duration. If the Fitbit records a sleep
duration under some target duration, the platform adds a reminder to the
client's Google Calendar to sleep more the next day. The platform connects the
Fitbit and Google Calendar services together through the recipe ``If sleep is
under a target duration, then add a reminder to Google Calendar.'' \kl{New example.}
%\kl{This 
%example is from the Walnut paper~\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2009-12447}, but we should come with
%another, more compelling example by analyzing more applets real people use.} 

One of the first and most popular TAPs is IFTTT (``If This Then That'') that
works with over 700 services and more than 20 million users around the
world~\cite{ifttt-website, DBLP:conf/sp/ChenCWSCF21}.  Because IFTTT has access
to a vast number of devices and users' data, and computes over sensitive data to
run millions of actions on their users' behalf, it is a prime target for
attackers. Many scholars have been examining IFTTT-like services for years to
point out their numerous security and privacy flaws and suggest better
practices~\cite{DBLP:conf/sp/ChenCWSCF21, DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2009-12447,
  DBLP:conf/imc/MiQZW17, DBLP:journals/corr/FernandesRJP17,
  DBLP:conf/www/SurbatovichABDJ17, DBLP:journals/access/XuZZCDG19}.  However,
even if there are ways to be more secure, private companies would not employ
them because they \emph{would} like to know everything about you as a user.

Today's TAPs learn much information about clients:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item the services (both trigger and action, for example Fitbit and Google Calendar),
  \item the recipe semantics (``If sleep is under a target duration, then add a
    reminder to Google Calendar.''),
  \item inputs to the applet (sleep duration), and
  \item outputs to the action service (the reminder).
\end{itemize}

Privacy-preserving TAPs (e.g., Chen et al.~\cite{DBLP:conf/sp/ChenCWSCF21} and
Walnut~\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2009-12447}) propose using multi-party
computation (MPC) to hide inputs to the applet from the TAP. However, prior work
doesn't cover all of the abovementioned sources of leakage, which is a
substantial fault. Ideally, the TAP should learn no information about the client
(besides timing information). In this project, we ask if such a TAP design is
possible, and if so, what are the costs.

The main contributions of this work are as follows:
