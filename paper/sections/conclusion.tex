\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This paper builds upon previous work in testing out security designs that would make trigger-action
platforms more secure. Security here is based on the principle that if TAP knows nothing, then it is able
to leak nothing. In reality, however, no system is perfectly secure, but we design a security scheme that
would allow to hide as much as possible. The proposed system operates on Garbled Circuits protocol
in the MPC library available on C++ in open source and functions as other TAPs on the market. But the
TAP itself does not know about the information it is getting, both the trigger and action do not know each
other, ELSE?
