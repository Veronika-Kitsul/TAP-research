  Trigger-action platforms (TAPs) allow users to connect IoT services to
  complete useful automation tasks. Recently, security researchers have come to
  understand the large-scale security and privacy risks associated with TAPs.
  Because they integrate with hundreds of other Internet services, compromised
  TAPs can expose sensitive data from all connected client devices and services.
  To mitigate these risks, we propose \sys, a practical privacy-preserving TAP
  that minimizes sensitive data collection by combining privacy-enhancing
  technologies such as end-to-end encryption, multi-party computation, anonymous
  tokens, and anonymous proxies. We implement a prototype of \sys in Rust that
  supports the most commonly used TAP functionality and does so with low
  performance overhead.
