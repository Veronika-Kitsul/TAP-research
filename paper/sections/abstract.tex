Trigger-Action Platforms (TAPs) receive increasingly more attention from both the users and security
researchers. Clients don't have to be skilled in technology to use TAPs to create automated functions
that would do repetitive monotonous tasks in a few seconds. Researchers understand potential large
scale security risks associated with it. Because TAP integrates with hundreds of other digital platforms,
attacking it might expose the data from all connected client devices and services. $\mathsf{ACACIA}$ is
an attempt to build a practical privacy-preserving TAP that would know as little data as possible so it
would be unable to pose a threat if its attacked. We use Multi-Party computation garbled circuits to
implement the prototype in Rust. Additionally, we introduce the Anonymity Extension that enables users
to install rules anonymously without leaking any private information.
