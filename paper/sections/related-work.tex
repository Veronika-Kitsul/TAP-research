\paragraph{eTAP.}
The $\mathsf{eTAP}$ system~\cite{DBLP:conf/sp/ChenCWSCF21} also aims to provide
privacy for trigger-action platforms. We follow their approach of executing
recipes using MPC, but find ways to reduce the amount of MPC required by
half. Moreover, we also develop techniques to unlink the installed recipes from
client identities.

\paragraph{Walnut.}


Walnut~\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2009-12447} is another system that aims to
provide privacy for trigger-action platforms using MPC, but using two
non-colluding servers instead of one. They also do not consider how to unlink
installed recipes from client identities.
